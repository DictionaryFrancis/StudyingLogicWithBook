Doing the Lab 2 Exercises

Exercise 2: 
Write a script that prints out on the terminal its name, the number of arguments it is called with 
and the names of those arguments. Try executing this script with varying number of arguments. 
Remember to comment your code.

It helps us understanding how scripts handle command-line arguments

#!/bin/bash

# Print the script name
echo "Script Name: $0"

# Print the number of arguments passed
echo "Number of Arguments: $#"

# Print the list of arguments
echo "Arguments Passed: $@"

$0 -> Refers to the name of the script
$# -> Gives the number of arguments passed
$@ -> List all arguments passed to the script


So for example  I insert the code to execute the file

chmod 755 [filename]

and execute it with the arguments to test

For example:
./filename Hey hello Francis

OUTPUT_FILE:
Script name: ./exercise2
Number of arguments: 3
Arguments Passed: Hey hello Francis
