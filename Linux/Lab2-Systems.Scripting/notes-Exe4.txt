Doing the Lab 2 Exercises


Exercise 4:  
Use at to schedule three different single jobs. First job should create a folder, second job 
should create a file inside the new folder and the third job should rename the folder. Allow 
time interval between the jobs. Use atq to confirm the scheduling of the jobs. After jobs has 
been executed check your working directory for the results. 


First Step before start it:
So at the first attempt using the schedule in Linux
I want to make a backup of the files that I have in one folder in another so here we go:

First I create the folder in my $HOME variable, a folder that will be the backup, after it I schedule the process
'at [time]'
it opens us a prompt to input our command

In our case it will be the copy of the documents
'cp -r $HOME/[filename] $HOME/[filename]'

CTRL + D (To leave the prompt session)

And it is done, it will schedule for [time]

If I want to see the scheduling I can command 'atq', if I want to delete the command I use 'atrm [schedule code]'

Another Command it will be 'cron' so this one will work in a geral way, so a recurring task, everyday certain hour this happen

So For example, if we want the backup happens everyday at 16:00 we have to:
'crontab'

it will open a input prompt:
0 16 * * * cp -r $HOME/[filename] $HOME/[filename]

CTRL + D (To leave the prompt session)

If you want to check digit the command:

crontab -l (List all the task)
crontab -e (Edit the tasks)
crontab -r (To remove all tasks)

Solving the exercise:
# Ensure the 'atd' service is running
sudo service atd start

# Schedule job 1: Create a folder "TestFolder" in the home directory (runs in 2 minutes)
echo "mkdir -p $HOME/TestFolder" | at now +2 minutes
echo "Job 1: Folder 'TestFolder' creation scheduled in 2 minutes."

# Schedule job 2: Create a file inside "TestFolder" (runs in 4 minutes)
echo "touch $HOME/TestFolder/file.txt" | at now +4 minutes
echo "Job 2: File 'file.txt' creation scheduled in 4 minutes."

# Schedule job 3: Rename "TestFolder" to "NewFolder" (runs in 6 minutes)
echo "mv $HOME/TestFolder $HOME/NewFolder" | at now +6 minutes
echo "Job 3: Rename 'TestFolder' to 'NewFolder' scheduled in 6 minutes."

# List all scheduled jobs
echo "Scheduled jobs:"
atq

OUTPUT:
Job 1: Folder 'TestFolder' creation scheduled in 2 minutes.
Job 2: File 'file.txt' creation scheduled in 4 minutes.
Job 3: Rename 'TestFolder' to 'NewFolder' scheduled in 6 minutes.
Scheduled jobs:
1    2025-02-16 14:02 a user
2    2025-02-16 14:04 a user
3    2025-02-16 14:06 a user
