Doing the Lab 2 Exercises


Exercise 3: 
Write a script that receives three input arguments. The script should create a folder and a file. 
The name of the folder is the value of the first input argument, the name of the file inside of it 
is the value of the second argument. The value of the third argument should be written in the 
newly created file. Use an appropriate command to only show the content of the file. Use 
comment to document your code. 

#!/bin/bash

# Check if exactly 3 arguments are passed
if [ "$#" -ne 3 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <folder_name> <file_name> <file_content>"
    exit 1
fi

# Store the arguments in variables
FOLDER_NAME=$1
FILE_NAME=$2
FILE_CONTENT=$3

# Create the folder 
mkdir "$FOLDER_NAME"

# Create the file inside the folder
touch "$FOLDER_NAME/$FILE_NAME"

# Write the content into the file
echo "$FILE_CONTENT" > "$FOLDER_NAME/$FILE_NAME"

# Display the content of the file
echo "Content of the file '$FILE_NAME' inside '$FOLDER_NAME':"
cat "$FOLDER_NAME/$FILE_NAME"

The if $# (represents the number of arguments) -ne(not equal)
So, if the number is not 3, it will not work (exit 1), if goes true will be 0( it means success)

# Store the arguments in variables
FOLDER_NAME=$1
FILE_NAME=$2
FILE_CONTENT=$3

They are not array, they just hold the the argument passed, it means if we does this example:

#!/bin/bash

echo "First argument: $1"
echo "Second argument: $2"
echo "Third argument: $3"

Running it:
./args_example.sh apple banana cherry

The result will be:
First argument: apple
Second argument: banana
Third argument: cherry


An array would be something like that:
#!/bin/bash

echo "All arguments: $@"

# Loop through all arguments
for arg in "$@"; do
    echo "Argument: $arg"
done
