Doing the Lab 2 Exercises


Exercise 5:  
Use at to schedule a script of your own (e.g. script from previous week or any other script) 
to run at a designated time (about two or three minutes in the future). 

I did this using the library zenity, a GUI for Linux

I did the bash script:
#!/bin/bash
zenity --info --title="Task Completed" --text="Hello, this script ran successfully!"

chmod 755 ./[filename]

./[filename] | at now +2 minutes
